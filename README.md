# Craigslist Alert System

This Craigslist Alert System is a tool that will notify you anytime a new posting that matches your parameters appears, via email. Why not just use the pre-existing alert system? Well, it's not the best and can sometimes lead to missed listings. Using this ensures that you recieve notification of a listing as soon as possible, giving you full autonomy and customization. 

Some reasons to use this –

- Run the script locally or on the cloud
- Modify it to suit your needs
- Be the first to see new listings (ex, PS5 for less than $600)
- No need to rely on craigslist servers & latency issues

## Installation

This tool requires [Python](https://python.org/) to run. Any version >= 2.7 should do however there may be packages that require Python3+ as a minimum in the future.

To get up and going –

1. Launch a virtual environment (optional)
2. Install the dependencies
3. Create a Gmail account to send the emails from
4. Modify the main script with your emails, credentials, and URL
5. Add your desired queries to query_list.json
5. Run script & enjoy
    
```sh
$ cd craigslist-alert-system
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ sh constant_run.sh
```
